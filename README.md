# Business Site

The assignment was to creat a business one-pager website that should contain an image or video header, a signup form, and an accordion. The focus was for us to practice what we've learned about image backgrounds, HTML forms, and how to modify the DOM with JavaScript. We were split up in groups of 3-5 people and worked together with mob programming on this project and we had approx. 7,5 hours to finish it.

## The problem

We started the project with planning in Figma. Then we did the HTML and some CSS in VS Code. We hade some issues with the Javascript at the end of Day 1 but we figured it out thanks to one of the teammates in our team. We continued with the CSS more on Day 2 and finished off with a stylesheet we were happy about and did our first demo with great comments and feedback. All of our problems could be solved through googling, watching links with useful material and overall great teamwork together.

If we had more time, we would probably spend a bit more on planning in the beginning and also draw out how the page would look like before starting with the code. We would also do a navigation bar to make the site look even better but with the short amount of time and considering we're in the beginning of this learning progress I'm proud over what we've accomplished together :)
